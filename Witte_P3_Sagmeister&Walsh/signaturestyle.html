        <p>Sagmeister &amp; Walsh is known for their experimental typography and visually striking imagery. They often play with large, eye-catching typography as central design elements. Their work is unsettling yet playful, humanist and existential, and often expands on the definition of design. Bright, bold colors are a hallmark of their work. They welcome film, sculpture, poetry, creative technologies, and performance into all their work. With these components they create a lot of mixed-media pieces throughout their work and exhibitions. Their work often experiments with design concepts that push the boundaries of traditional graphic design. They are not afraid to address controversial of thought-provoking topics in their work.</p>

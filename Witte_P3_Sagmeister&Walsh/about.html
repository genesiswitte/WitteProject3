        <p>Jessica Walsh began designing from a very young age. She had already taught herself how to code websites at the age of 11, but by the age of 12 she was interested in learning how to expand her websites beyond what code could accomplish. In high school, she did freelance web work for individuals and small businesses. Attending the Rhode Island School of Design where she received her BFA. Here, she was forced to take many fine arts classes working with her hands which was difficult since she was so accustomed to only working on a computer. Although she claims it was challenging at first, it helped her realize the potential she had to merge analogue work with digital work to make it more interesting. Walsh claims that this has had a huge influence on her work ever since.</p>

        <p>Stefan Sagmeister claims that he became a designer after failing at being a musician and a journalist. He realized that he was more interested in the layouts of newspaper and CDs than anything else, so he went on to study graphic design at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna. In 1987, he was awarded a scholarship to attend the Pratt Institute in New York which led to him getting a job with a design group in Hong Kong, where he worked until 1993. In 1993 Sagmeister returned to New York a to work for the Hungarian designer Tibor Kalman. Soon after, Sagmeister opened his own design studio, which he named, Sagmeister Inc.</p>
